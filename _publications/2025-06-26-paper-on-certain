title: "ON A CERTAIN STOCHASTIC ALGEBRAIC-DIFFERENTIAL
INCLUSION WITH MEAN DERIVATIVES, SATISFYING THE
RANK-DEGREE CONDITION"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2025-06-26-paper-on-certain
excerpt: 'In this paper we study a Leontief-type inclusion with symmetric
first-order mean derivative whose matrix pencil is regular and satisfies the
rank-degree condition. We prove the existence of a perfect solution and a
solution that minimizes some quality functional for such inclusion.'
