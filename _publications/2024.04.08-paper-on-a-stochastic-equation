excerpt: 'We investigate a stochastic second order algebraic-differential equation with mean derivatives whose matrix pencil is regular and satisfies the rank-degree condition. This equation is modelling dynamically distorted signals in an electronic device so that the quantum effects are taken into account that turn the deterministic incoming signal into a stochastic process. We prove the existence of solution of this equation.'
